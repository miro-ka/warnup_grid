## About ##

Warnup Grid is a Smart Notification Network, that primarily helps to monitor crime events detected from social media and network activities. Detected crime events and crime predictions will be forwarded to assigned users, that can specify area/location that want to monitor.


Main idea behind Warnup is to:
* Increase the chance of avoiding a crime for anybody and for free.
* Try to predict a crime.
* Monitory crime activity and run specific analysis on top of its data.
